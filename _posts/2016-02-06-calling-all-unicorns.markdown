Welcome fellow multidisciplinary designers and developers! My name is Alex. I created this group to connect with all of you, talk about our collective experiences and share our skills. I’ve never embraced the term, “Unicorn” but it’s always been an accurate description of my career. My primary focus has always been UI design and front-end development. Mix in user experience, strategy, architecture, entrepreneurship, and programming languages such as Ruby and Python and the horn grows larger.

We’re a rare breed. We care deeply about design. We have the ability to make anything we do beautiful, useable, and real. Sure, we might not be the best designer, or best developer, but we’re able to work faster than anyone else. We see the larger picture and understand how important each piece is.

I’m looking forward to meeting all of you. I want to make sure this group is as productive as possible. I encourage everyone involved to share and teach anything you feel passionate about. We’ll do workshops, mini how-to’s, guest speaking, and more. It seems like every week I’m trying out a new framework, or finding a better way to mock up new designs. Never stop learning.

More information to come on meetup #1.
